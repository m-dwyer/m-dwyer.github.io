I thought I should attempt to start <em>some</em> platform to rant and share things on, tech related and whatnot.\nSo - here's my first blog, which I'll use to share anything related to Linux, development, maybe some fitness and other miscellaneous subjects.</p>\n<p>Bear with me, as this site also will also serve as a starting point for (re)learning some web development.  For the past few years, I've largely concentrated on Ruby, C#, some BASH and other scripting -- so I'm picking up web again and I'm very rusty!</p>\n<p>Along the way, I'm hoping to document anything interesting I find.  There have been many moments previously where, beyond a git repository, I've thought 'I should probably take note of this somewhere, and share with others'.  So, now I have no excuses!</p>\n<p>A static site generator seemed like my best option, as it's trivial to register a domain, and link back to Github Pages.  I decided to go with Jekyll for the simple reason that it seems simple and straightforward to start with, and I'm already familiar with Ruby.  However, I am starting to (re)learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and hoping to pick up Node and React.  Eventually, I'd like to try out another static site generator, such as Gatesby.</p>\n<p>As you have undoubtedly noticed, front end development is not my forte.  My background has mostly been backend (some very minor front end web, and Windows Forms applications), so I will be attempting to place a degree of emphasis on this over the coming months, and learning to make things pretty.  Obviously I have a long way to go!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First post"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020-03-20-first copy 7/"}}}
